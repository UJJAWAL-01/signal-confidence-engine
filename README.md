## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Trend Analysis**
   - Compares short-term and long-term moving averages

2. **Momentum**
   - Uses RSI to measure buying/selling pressure

3. **Volume Validation**
   - Confirms price moves using volume participation

4. **Price Structure**
   - Evaluates Fibonacci pivot positioning

Each component contributes to a weighted confidence score. Daily signals are combined with weekly confirmation to generate a final confluence score.
